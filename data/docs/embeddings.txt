In machine learning, embeddings are a way of representing data as numerical vectors in a continuous space. They capture the meaning or relationship between data points, so that similar items are placed closer together while dissimilar ones are farther apart. This makes it easier for algorithms to work with complex data such as words, images or audios in a recommendation system.

They convert categorical or high-dimensional data into dense vectors.
They help machine learning models work with different types of data.
These vectors help show what the objects mean and how they relate to each other.
They are widely used in natural language processing, recommender systems and computer vision.

Word
In the above graph, we observe distinct clusters of related words.

For instance "computer", "software" and "machine" are clustered together, indicating their semantic similarity.
Similarly "lion", "cow" ,"cat" and "dog" form another cluster, representing their shared attributes.
There exists a significant gap between these clusters highlighting their dissimilarity in meaning or context.
Key terms used for Embedding
1. Vector
A vector is a list of numbers that describes a size (magnitude) and a direction. In machine learning, it usually means a set of numbers that shows features or characteristics of something.
Example: In 2D, the vector points 3 steps along the x-axis and 4 steps along the y-axis. Its total length (magnitude) is 5.
2. Dense Vector
A dense vector is a type of vector where most numbers are not zero. In machine learning, dense vectors are often used to describe things like words, images or data points because they capture a lot of details.
Example: [2000, 3, 5, 9.8] could describe a house, showing size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms and age.
3. Vector space
A vector space or linear space is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars, satisfying certain properties. It satisfy the certain properties like Closure under addition and Scalar multiplication.
Example: The set of all 3D vectors with real-number coordinates forms a vector space like the vectors [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] and [0, 0, 1] constitute a basis for the 3D vector space.
4. Continuous Vector space
A continuous vector space is a special kind of vector space where each value can be any real number (not just whole numbers). In embeddings, it means every object can be described with numbers that can smoothly change.
Example: The color [0.9, 0.3, 0.1] in RGB shows a shade of red, where each number can be any value between 0 and 1.
How do Embeddings Work?
Let's see how embeddings work:

1. Define similarity signal:
First, decide what we want the model to treat as “similar”.

Text: Words or sentences that appear in similar contexts.
Images: Pictures of the same object or scene.
Graphs: Nodes that are connected or related.
2. Choose dimensionality:
Select how many numbers (dimensions) will describe each item, it could be 64, 384, 768 or more.

More dimensions: more detail but slower and uses more memory.
Fewer dimensions: faster but may lose detail.
3. Build the encoder
This is the model that turns our data into a list of numbers (vector):

Text: Language models like BERT.
Images: Vision models like CNN or ViT.
Audio: Models that process sound (e.g., turning it into spectrograms first).
Graphs: Methods like Node2Vec or graph neural networks.
Tabular data: Models that compress features into embeddings.
4. Train with a metric-learning objective:
Show the model examples of things that are “similar” and “different.”
Teach it to place similar ones close together and different ones far apart.
This process is called metric learning.
5. Negative sampling and batching:
Give the model tricky “hard negative” examples, things that seem alike but aren’t so it learns to tell them apart better.

6. Validate and Tune
Test how well our embeddings work by checking:

How accurate search results are.
How well items group into the right categories.
How good automatic clustering is.
If the results aren’t good, adjust vector size, training method or data.

7. Index for Fast Retrieval
Store our vectors in a special database like Qdrant or FAISS to quickly find the closest matches, even from millions of items.

8. Use the embeddings
Once ready, embeddings can be used for:

Semantic search: finding by meaning, not exact words.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): feeding relevant facts to an AI model.
Classification: predicting the correct label or category.
Clustering: grouping similar items together.
Recommendations: suggesting similar products, content or users.
Monitoring: spotting unusual changes or patterns over time.
Importance of Embedding
Embeddings are used across various domains and tasks for several reasons:

Semantic Representation: Embeddings capture semantic relationships between entities in the data. For example, in word embeddings, words with similar meanings are mapped to nearby points in the vector space.
Dimensionality Reduction: Embeddings reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving important features and relationships.
Transfer Learning: Embeddings learned from one task or domain can be transferred and fine-tuned for use in related tasks or domains.
Feature Engineering: Embeddings automatically extract meaningful features from raw data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
Interpretability: Embeddings provide interpretable representations of data. For example, in word embeddings, the direction and distance between word vectors can correspond to meaningful relationships such as gender, tense or sentiment.
Objects that can be Embedded
From textual data to images and beyond, embeddings offer a versatile approach to encoding information into dense vector representations. Some of the major types of objects or values that can be embedded include:

1. Words
Word embeddings are numeric vectors that represent words in a continuous space, where similar words are placed near each other. These vectors are learned from large text datasets and capture the meanings and relationships between words making it easier for computers to understand and process language in tasks like sentiment analysis and translation.

Some of the Popular word embeddings include:

Word2Vec
GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)
FastText
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
GPT
2. Complete Text Document
Text embeddings or document embeddings represent entire sentences, paragraphs or documents as numeric vectors in a continuous space. Unlike word embeddings that focus on single words, text embeddings capture the meaning and context of longer text segments. This allows for easier comparison and analysis of complete pieces of text in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, translation or document classification.

Some of the Popular text embedding models include:

Doc2Vec
Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)
BERT
ELMO
3. Audio Data
Audio data includes individual sound samples, audio clips and entire audio recordings. By representing audio as dense vectors in a continuous vector space, embedding techniques effectively capture acoustic features and relationships. This enables a wide range of audio processing tasks such as speech recognition, speaker identification, emotion detection and music genre classification.

Some of the popular Audio embedding techniques may include Wav2Vec

4. Image Data
Image embeddings are numerical representations of images in a continuous vector space, extracted by processing images through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These embeddings encode the visual content, features and semantics of images, facilitating efficient understanding and processing of visual information by machines.

Some of the popular CNNs based Image embedding techniques include:

VGG
ResNet
Inception
EfficientNet
5. Graph Data
Graph embeddings convert a graph’s nodes and edges into numeric vectors, capturing the graph’s structure and relationships. This representation makes complex graph data easier for machine learning models to use enabling tasks like node classification, link prediction and clustering.

Some popular graph embedding techniques include:

Node2Vec
DeepWalk
Graph Convolutional Networks
6. Structured Data
Structured data such as feature vectors and tables can be embedded to help machine learning models capture underlying patterns. Common techniques include Autoencoders



AI embeddings offer the potential to generate superior training data, enhancing data quality and minimizing manual labeling requirements. By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.

Machine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.

Importance of High-Quality Training Data
The importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.

The quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google’s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world’s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google’s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  

In image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.

At the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.

The images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. 

Hence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.
